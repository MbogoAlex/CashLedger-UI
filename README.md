Cash Ledger is a simple yet powerful SMS based ledger app that will help you track and analyze all your M-PESA transactions. The app helps you see the sum total of your daily money-in and money-out together with the individual transactions. The date range can be adjusted as you wish and so you can see the total money-in and money-out, together with the individual transactions, for a time range of your choice.

Cash Ledger enables you to analyze money received from various grouped sources, including M-SHWARI accounts, as well as money sent grouped into money sent to personal mobile accounts, Till accounts, Paybill accounts, M-SHWARI and KCB transfers and M-PESA withdrawals. Using the search feature, you can further narrow down transactions based on specific accounts and within a chosen date range. So you can track your fuliza loans, hustler fund loans, reversals, and more. The app also allows you to create custom categories.

The ledger app also displays analysis sorted in descending order. You have two choices, see your transactions sorted in descending order according to frequency of transactions (frequent recipients or senders) or according to the amount transacted, for a time period of your choice.

Cash Ledger also allows you to download statements of your transactions in pdf or csv format, and launch them from the appâ€™s files folder. Using the search and calendar features, you can customize the statements to be downloaded. You can download statements of all transactions, money-in transactions, money-out transactions or money-in and money-out transactions sorted in descending order for a date range of your choice.

The current version of the Cash Ledger app is for personal M-PESA accounts.
